# Global Configs

The src/app/material-configs folder contains global configs for all Angular Material components that support them.

You can set your most commonly used config settings here, such as dialog configs, or table paginator configs, so you don't have to repeat a bunch of boilerplate throughout the app. You can still override these values by changing them in each component - you just don't need to do that all the time.
